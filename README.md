## Folder Structure

- **AVLtree**:  
  **Concept**: Self-balancing binary search tree, maintaining logarithmic time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.
  
- **Array2D**:  
  **Concept**: Two-dimensional array or matrix, often used to represent grid-like data or solve problems involving multiple dimensions.

- **ArrayList**:  
  **Concept**: Dynamic array used to store elements, supports random access and dynamic resizing.

- **Arrays**:  
  **Concept**: Basic linear data structure used to store a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.

- **Backtracking**:  
  **Concept**: Algorithmic technique for finding all or some solutions to problems by trying partial solutions and discarding them if they fail to satisfy the conditions.

- **BinarySearchTree**:  
  **Concept**: A tree structure where each node has at most two children, and the left child has a value less than the parent node, with efficient search, insert, and delete operations.

- **BinaryTree**:  
  **Concept**: A hierarchical tree data structure with a root and subtrees, where each node has at most two children.

- **BitManipulation**:  
  **Concept**: Performing operations on bits to solve problems efficiently, often used in optimization.

- **DivideAndConquer**:  
  **Concept**: Algorithm paradigm that divides the problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and combines their results.

- **DynamicProgramming**:  
  **Concept**: Solving problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem once, saving results to avoid redundant computation.

- **Graph**:  
  **Concept**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, used to represent networks, relationships, and traversal problems.

- **GreedyAlgo**:  
  **Concept**: An algorithmic approach that makes locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.

- **Hashing**:  
  **Concept**: Storing data in a way that allows for fast access through a hash function, used in hash tables.

- **Heap**:  
  **Concept**: A special tree-based data structure used to implement priority queues, where the parent node is either greater than or less than its children.

- **LinkedList**:  
  **Concept**: A linear data structure where elements (nodes) are stored in a sequence, each node containing data and a reference to the next node.

- **OOPs**:  
  **Concept**: Object-Oriented Programming principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction for better code organization and reuse.

- **Patterns**:  
  **Concept**: Using loops to create common pattern-based outputs, useful for understanding loops and recursion.

- **Queue**:  
  **Concept**: A linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) principle, used in scenarios like scheduling and buffering.

- **Recursion**:  
  **Concept**: A method where the function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.

- **SegmentTree**:  
  **Concept**: A binary tree used to store intervals or segments and efficiently query and update ranges of values.

- **Sorting**:  
  **Concept**: Arranging elements in a specific order (ascending or descending), with algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort, etc.

- **Stack**:  
  **Concept**: A linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) principle, used for function calls, undo operations, and expression evaluation.

- **String**:  
  **Concept**: A sequence of characters, commonly used for text processing and pattern matching problems.

- **Trie**:  
  **Concept**: A tree-like data structure that stores strings in a way that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of keys.
